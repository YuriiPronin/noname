In this project, I implemented a fake online store using a public api - https://fakestoreapi.com/

<b>Functionality:</b>

1. Search by keywords
2. Product sorting (by price from lowest/from highest and by rating)
3. Adding the product to the cart
4. Removing an individual product from the cart
5. Increase in units of the selected product
6. Unfortunately, the authorization form has not yet been implemented - it will be later

<b>Technologies:</b>
